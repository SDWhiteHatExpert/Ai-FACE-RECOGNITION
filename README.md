# Ai-FACE-RECOGNITION
AI Face Recognition Project

Overview:

Welcome to the AI Face Recognition project, developed by TECHY SDX. This project utilizes state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to recognize faces in images and videos.

Features:

Face detection: The system can accurately detect human faces in images and videos.
Face recognition: Once faces are detected, the system can recognize known faces based on a pre-trained model.
Customizable: The project allows for easy integration of custom datasets for training and recognition.
Real-time processing: The system is optimized for real-time face detection and recognition, making it suitable for various applications.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation:
